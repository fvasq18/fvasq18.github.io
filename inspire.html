        <h2>What makes Lefty SM a hero?</h2>
        <p>Lefty was a Mexican rapper from the state of Sonora. During his career, he was able to pull in millions of streams and became one of Mexico's biggest artists.  </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Lefty was murdered in September of 2023. His death was tragic and fans were mouring the loss of a great talent. Lefty is my hero because he means what he says. In a lot of his music, he describes himself as someone who is somewhat of a badass. </p>
        <p>I never doubted it, but it was proven true when video footage of his murder was released. Even when he was outnumbered, three to one, he was able to put up a fight againts his murderers. I highly respect him for having grit and reminds me to strive forward no matter the odds.</p>

    <h1>Things I find amusing!</h1>
    <h2>By Francisco Vasquez</h2>

    <h2>YouTube</h2>
    <p>I find Youtube very amusing as I have a wide variety of videos available in an instant. Entertainment, music, or education videos are all able to be found on YouTube.</p>

    <h2>Spotify</h2>
    <p>I find Spotify amusing as it has access to thousands and thousands of songs. I also enjoy some of their unique features such as making daily mixes and showing you a recap of your year.</p>

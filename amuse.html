    <h1>Things I find amusing!</h1>
    <h2><em>By Francisco Vasquez</em></h2>

    <h2>YouTube</h2>
    <p>I find Youtube very amusing as I have a wide variety of videos available in an instant. Entertainment, music, or education videos are all able to be found on YouTube.</p>

    <h2>Spotify</h2>
    <p>I find Spotify amusing as it has access to thousands and thousands of songs. I also enjoy some of their unique features such as making daily mixes and showing you a recap of your year.</p>

    <h2>Xbox</h2>
    <p>The last thing I find amusing is Xbox. Specifically, their Xbox app. This app makes it easy to see if your friends are online and you are also able to download games from your phone.</p>
